4.	Features 

The navigation bar connects to four pages: main, agenda, review, and contact. Main page introduces the company. Agenda page shows the management of projects using ASP.NET (MVC) framework. Review page is used to do analysis of customer reviews using ML.NET library. Contact page contains address, phone number and social media links. 

5.	Data design 

We use Entity Framework Core to manipulate the data names of projects when we create or read or update or delete. We use the library ML.NET to train the data to make analysis of reviews. We choose a local file in tsv format.

6.	Challenges

We add razor file using bootstrap framework in ASP.NET Core. MVC design need to be done with good wiring between models, controllers, and services. We need to connect the ML.NET model with the main web site. I already read and watch a tutorial about razor, MVC and ML.NET in ASP.NET Core.

7.	Frameworks and languages 

dot NET CORE[MVC-Razor Pages], C#, CSS, JavaScript and ML.NET
