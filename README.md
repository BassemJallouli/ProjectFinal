**Portfolio Website

1.	Objective 

The project is my portfolio web site. The visitor can discover my profile, my full stack conferences page and my machine learning page doing reviews for comments in real time. I add interests page to have an idea about my personality and my hobbies. It is great tool to present my software skills using C# in ASP.NET Core and the library ML.NET.

2.	Description 

The web site will introduce my professional profile. The page full stack introduces the conferences, during the program of TECHCareer, you can create or read or update or delete a conference. The user can do sentiment analysis of reviews using machine learning library. The visitor can connect to my Linkedin and Github profile.

3.	Installation

The web site needs installation of special libraries. Download and install the ML.NET Model Builder tool from the Visual Studio Marketplace. It is important to add Microsoft.Extensions.ML and Entity Framework Core from NuGet Packages.

4.	Features 

The navigation bar connects to four pages: home, full stack, machine learning, resume and interests. Main page introduces my professional motivation. full stack page shows the presentation of conferences using ASP.NET (MVC) framework. Machine learning page is used to do analysis of customer reviews using ML.NET library. Interests page contains Youtube video links to my hobbies. 

5.	Data design 

We use Entity Framework Core to manipulate the data names of projects when we create or read or update or delete. We use the library ML.NET to train the data to make analysis of reviews. We choose a local file in tsv format.

6.	Challenges

We add razor file using bootstrap framework in ASP.NET Core. MVC razor page design need to be done with good wiring between models, controllers, and services. We need to connect the ML.NET model with the main web site. I already read and watch a tutorial about razor, MVC and ML.NET in ASP.NET Core.

7.	Frameworks and languages 

dot NET CORE[MVC-Razor Pages], C#, CSS, JavaScript and ML.NET
